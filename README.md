# chickenexpress-hubspot-forms-proxy-main
Serverless proxy for Chicken Express HubSpot forms. Deployed on Vercel to handle multipart submissions (including file uploads) from HubSpot forms embedded in third-party iframes (e.g., DoorDash). Forwards submissions securely to HubSpotâ€™s formsnext/multipart API, bypassing iframe sandbox and CORS restrictions.
